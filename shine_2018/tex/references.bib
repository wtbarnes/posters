  abstract = {The recent analysis of observations taken with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer and X-Ray Telescope instruments on Hinode suggests that well-constrained measurements of the temperature distribution in solar active regions can finally be made. Such measurements are critical for constraining theories of coronal heating. Past analysis, however, has suffered from limited sample sizes and large uncertainties at temperatures between 5 and 10~MK. Here we present a systematic study of the differential emission measure distribution in 15 active region cores. We focus on measurements in the inter-moss region, that is, the region between the loop footpoints, where the observations are easier to interpret. To reduce the uncertainties at the highest temperatures we present a new method for isolating the Fe XVIII emission in the AIA/SDO 94 \AA{} channel. The resulting differential emission measure distributions confirm our previous analysis showing that the temperature distribution in an active region core is often strongly peaked near 4~MK. We characterize the properties of the emission distribution as a function of the total unsigned magnetic flux. We find that the amount of high-temperature emission in the active region core is correlated with the total unsigned magnetic flux, while the emission at lower temperatures, in contrast, is inversely related. These results provide compelling evidence that high-temperature active region emission is often close to equilibrium, although weaker active regions may be dominated by evolving million degree loops in the core.},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/200810735},
  abstract = {Context: The effects of non-equilibrium processes on the ionisation 
state of strongly emitting elements in the solar corona can be extremely
difficult to assess and yet they are critically important. For example,
there is much interest in dynamic heating events localised in the solar
corona because they are believed to be responsible for its high
temperature and yet recent work has shown that the hottest
($\geq$107 K) emission predicted to be associated with these
events can be observationally elusive due to the difficulty of creating
the highly ionised states from which the expected emission arises. This
leads to the possibility of observing instruments missing such heating
events entirely. Aims: The equations describing the evolution of
the ionisaton state are a very stiff system of coupled, partial
differential equations whose solution can be numerically challenging and
time-consuming. Without access to specialised codes and significant
computational resources it is extremely difficult to avoid the
assumption of an equilibrium ionisation state even when it clearly
cannot be justified. The aim of the current work is to develop a
computational tool to allow straightforward calculation of the
time-dependent ionisation state for a wide variety of physical
circumstances. Methods: A numerical model comprising the system
of time-dependent ionisation equations for a particular element and
tabulated values of plasma temperature as a function of time is
developed. The tabulated values can be the solutions of an analytical
model, the output from a numerical code or a set of observational
measurements. An efficient numerical method to solve the ionisation
equations is implemented. Results: A suite of tests is designed
and run to demonstrate that the code provides reliable and accurate
solutions for a number of scenarios including equilibration of the ion
population and rapid heating followed by thermal conductive cooling. It
is found that the solver can evolve the ionisation state to recover
exactly the equilibrium state found by an independent, steady-state
solver for all temperatures, resolve the extremely small
ionisation/recombination timescales associated with rapid temperature
changes at high densities, and provide stable and accurate solutions for
both dominant and minor ion population fractions. Rapid heating and
cooling of low to moderate density plasma is characterised by
significant non-equilibrium ionisation conditions. The effective
ionisation temperatures are significantly lower than the electron
temperature and the values found are in close agreement with the
previous work of others. At the very highest densities included in the
present study an assumption of equilibrium ionisation is found to be
robust. Conclusions: The computational tool presented here
provides a straightforward and reliable way to calculate ionisation
states for a wide variety of physical circumstances. The numerical code
gives results that are accurate and consistent with previous studies,
has relatively undemanding computational requirements and is freely
available from the author.},

energy. The results reveal how the loop is filled at supersonic speed

it is predicted that a compression wave will propagate down toward the
photosphere. Once the heating pulse stops, the plasma that has risen
into the loop starts to decay and return to the condition it was in

predicting the spectrum that would be emitted by such a plasma. The
first and main part of this calculation involves setting up and solving
the time-dependent equations of ionization/recombination. To provide a
standard for comparison, the same ionization and recombination rate

With cooled detectors, high sensitivity, and high spectral resolution, EUNIS-13 resolves the lines of Fe XIX at 592.2 \AA{} (formed at temperature T 8.9 MK) and Fe XII at 592.6 \AA{} (T 1.6 MK). The Fe XIX line emission, observed over an area in excess of 4920 arcsec2 (2.58 \texttimes{} 109 km2, more than 60\% of the active region), provides strong evidence for the nanoflare heating model of the solar corona. No GOES events occurred in the region less than 2 hr before the rocket flight, but a microflare was observed north and east of the region with RHESSI and EUNIS during the flight. The absence of significant upward velocities anywhere in the region, particularly the microflare, indicates that the pervasive Fe XIX emission is not propelled outward from the microflare site, but is most likely attributed to localized heating (not necessarily due to reconnection) consistent with the nanoflare heating model of the solar corona. Assuming ionization equilibrium we estimate Fe XIX/Fe XII emission measure ratios of \textasciitilde{}0.076 just outside the AR core and \textasciitilde{}0.59 in the core.},

  abstract = {The location and frequency of coronal energy release provide a significant constraint on the coronal heating mechanism. The evolution of the intensity observed in coronal structures found from time lag analysis of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) data has been used to argue that heating must occur sporadically. Recently, we have demonstrated that quasi-steady, highly stratified (footpoint) heating can produce results qualitatively consistent with the evolution of observed coronal structures. The goals of this paper are to demonstrate that time lag analysis of 3D simulations of footpoint heating are qualitatively consistent with time lag analysis of observations and to use the 3D simulations to further understand whether time lag analysis is a useful tool in defining the evolution of coronal structures. We find the time lag maps generated from simulated data are consistent with the observed time lag maps. We next investigate several example points. In some cases, the calculated time lag reflects the evolution of a unique loop along the line of sight, though there may be additional evolving structures along the line of sight. We confirm that using the multi-peak AIA channels can produce time lags that are difficult to interpret. We suggest using a different high temperature channel, such as an X-ray channel. Finally, we find that multiple evolving structures along the line of sight can produce time lags that do not represent the physical properties of any structure along the line of sight, although the cross-correlation coefficient of the lightcurves is high. Considering the projected geometry of the loops may reduce some of the line-of-sight confusion.},

clues to the time dependence of the underlying heating mechanism. A
strongly nonlinear scaling of the emission measure with temperature
indicates a large amount of hot plasma relative to warm plasma. A weakly
nonlinear (or linear) scaling of the emission measure indicates a
relatively large amount of warm plasma, suggesting that the hot active
region plasma is allowed to cool and so the heating is impulsive with a
long repeat time. This case is called low-frequency nanoflare heating,
and we investigate its feasibility as an active region heating scenario
here. We explore a parameter space of heating and coronal loop
properties with a hydrodynamic model. For each model run, we calculate
the slope $\alpha$ of the emission measure distribution EM(T)vpropT
$\alpha$. Our conclusions are: (1) low-frequency nanoflare
heating is consistent with about 36\% of observed active region cores
when uncertainties in the atomic data are not accounted for; (2) proper
consideration of uncertainties yields a range in which as many as 77\% of
observed active regions are consistent with low-frequency nanoflare
heating and as few as zero; (3) low-frequency nanoflare heating cannot
explain observed slopes greater than 3; (4) the upper limit to the
volumetric energy release is in the region of 50 erg cm-3 to
avoid unphysical magnetic field strengths; (5) the heating timescale may
be short for loops of total length less than 40 Mm to be consistent with
the observed range of slopes; (6) predicted slopes are consistently

  abstract = {Aims: To demonstrate the capabilities of regularized inversion to 
recover differential emission measures (DEMs) from multi-wavelength
observations provided by telescopes such as Hinode and SDO. 
Methods: We develop and apply an enhanced regularization algorithm, used
in RHESSI X-ray spectral analysis, to constrain the ill-posed inverse
problem that is determining the DEM from solar observations. We
demonstrate this computationally fast technique applied to a range of
DEM models simulating broadband imaging data from SDO/AIA and high
resolution line spectra from Hinode/EIS, as well as actual active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT. As this regularization method
naturally provides both vertical and horizontal (temperature resolution)
error bars we are able to test the role of uncertainties in the data and
response functions. Results: The regularization method is able to
successfully recover the DEM from simulated data of a variety of model
DEMs (single Gaussian, multiple Gaussians and CHIANTI DEM models). It is
able to do this, at best, to over four orders of magnitude in DEM space
but typically over two orders of magnitude from peak emission. The
combination of horizontal and vertical error bars and the regularized
solution matrix allows us to easily determine the accuracy and
robustness of the regularized DEM. We find that the typical range for
the horizontal errors is $\Delta$log T $\approx$ 0.1-0.5 and this is dependent
on the observed signal to noise, uncertainty in the response functions
as well as the source model and temperature. With Hinode/EIS an
uncertainty of 20\% greatly broadens the regularized DEMs for both
Gaussian and CHIANTI models although information about the underlying
DEMs is still recoverable. When applied to real active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT the regularization method is able
to recover a DEM similar to that found via a MCMC method but in
considerably less computational time. Conclusions: Regularized
inversion quickly determines the DEM from solar observations and
provides reliable error estimates (both horizontal and vertical) which
allows the temperature spread of coronal plasma to be robustly
quantified.},

  abstract = {A well-known behavior of EUV light curves of discrete coronal loops is 
that the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are
reached at progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag
is understood to be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling
through these lower respective temperatures. However, loops typically
comprise only a minority of the total emission in active regions (ARs).
Is this cooling pattern a common property of AR coronal plasma, or does
it only occur in unique circumstances, locations, and times? The new
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) data
provide a wonderful opportunity to answer this question systematically
for an entire AR. We measure the time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV
channels using 24 hr of images of AR 11082 observed on 2010 June 19. We
find that there is a time-lag signal consistent with cooling plasma,
just as is usually found for loops, throughout the AR including the
diffuse emission between loops for the entire 24 hr duration. The
pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and choice of window
length within the 24 hr time period, giving us confidence that the
plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and sometimes
exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}0.8 MK. This suggests
that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this AR is not steady;
rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements
provide crucial constraints on any model which seeks to describe coronal
heating.},

spaced nanoflares cannot account for the observed range of a if the

delay between consecutive nanoflares proportional to the energy of the
second nanoflare do lead to the observed range of a. However,
TN must then be of the order of hundreds to no more than a
few thousand seconds. If a nanoflare leads to the relaxation of a
stressed coronal field to a near-potential state, the time taken to
build up the required magnetic energy is thus too long to account for
the EM measurements. Instead, it is suggested that a nanoflare involves
the relaxation from one stressed coronal state to another, dissipating

that nanoflare energies may be smaller than previously envisioned.},

(2) The details of coronal heating matter. (3) The corona is filled with elemental magnetic stands. (4) The corona is densely populated with current sheets. (5) The strands must reconnect to prevent an infinite build-up of stress. (6) Nanoflares repeat with different frequencies. (7) What is the characteristic magnitude of energy release? (8) What causes the collective behaviour responsible for loops? (9) What are the onset conditions for energy release? (10) Chromospheric
nanoflares are not a primary source of coronal plasma. Significant progress in solving the coronal heating problem will require
coordination of approaches: observational studies, field-aligned hydrodynamic simulations, large-scale and localized three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and possibly also kinetic simulations. There is a unique value to each of these approaches, and the community must strive to coordinate better.},

  abstract = {Observations of the sun with high time and spatial resolution in UV and X-rays show that the emission from small isolated magnetic bipoles is intermittent and impulsive, while the steadier emission from larger bipoles appears as the sum of many individual impulses. We refer to the basic unit of impulsive energy release as a nanoflare. The observations suggest, then, that the active X-ray corona of the sun is to be
understood as a swarm of nanoflares. This interpretation suggests that the X-ray corona is created by the dissipation at the many tangential discontinuities arising spontaneously in the bipolar fields of the active regions of the sun as a consequence of random continuous motion of the footpoints of the field in the photospheric convection. The quantitative characteristics of the process are inferred from the observed coronal heat input.},

It contains data and software for modeling optically thin atom and positive ion emission from low density ($\lessequivlnt$10 13 cm -3 ) plasmas from x-ray to infrared wavelengths. A key feature is that the data are assessed and regularly updated, with version 8 released in 2015. Atomic data for modeling the emissivities of 246 ions and neutrals are contained in CHIANTI, together with data for deriving the ionization fractions of all elements up to zinc. The different types of atomic data are summarized here and their formats discussed. Statistics on the impact of CHIANTI to the astrophysical community are given and examples of the diverse range of applications are presented.},

  abstract = {This paper presents SunPy (version 0.5), a community-developed Python package for solar physics. Python, a free, cross-platform,
general-purpose, high-level programming language, has seen widespread adoption among the scientific community, resulting in the availability of a large number of software packages, from numerical computation (NumPy, SciPy) and machine learning (scikit-learn) to visualization and plotting (matplotlib). SunPy is a data-analysis environment specializing in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It
currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and
STEREO/SWAVES. We describe SunPy's functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools already available in Python. We discuss the future goals of the project and encourage interested users to become involved in the planning and development of SunPy.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine 15 different active regions (ARs) observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory and analyze their nanoflare properties. We have recently developed a technique that systematically identifies and measures plasma temperature dynamics by computing time lags between light curves. The time lag method tests whether the plasma is maintained at a steady temperature, or if it is dynamic, undergoing heating and cooling cycles. An important aspect of our technique is that it analyzes both observationally distinct coronal loops as well as the much more prevalent diffuse emission between them. We find that the widespread cooling reported previously for NOAA AR 11082 is a generic property of all ARs. The results are consistent with impulsive nanoflare heating followed by slower cooling. Only occasionally, however, is there full cooling from above 7 MK to well below 1 MK. More often, the plasma cools to approximately 1\textendash{}2 MK before being reheated by another nanoflare. These same 15 ARs were first studied by Warren et al. We find that the degree of cooling is not well correlated with the reported slopes of the emission measure distribution. We also conclude that the Fe xviii emitting plasma that they measured is mostly in a state of cooling. These results support the idea that nanoflares have a distribution of energies and frequencies, with the average delay between successive events on an individual flux tube being comparable to the plasma cooling timescale.},

              . Each event would heat and cool quickly, and the average effect would be a broad range of temperatures including a small amount of extremely hot plasma. However, detecting these faint, hot traces in the presence of brighter, cooler emission is observationally challenging. Here we present hard X-ray data from the second flight of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI-2), which detected emission above 7\,keV from an active region of the Sun with no obvious individual X-ray flare emission. Through differential emission measure computations, we ascribe this emission to plasma heated above 10\,MK, providing evidence for the existence of solar nanoflares. The quantitative evaluation of the hot plasma strongly constrains the coronal heating models. The authors detect hard X-ray emission produced by plasma heated at $\geq$10 million kelvin from a quiescent active region of the Sun, providing clear observational evidence of plasma heating by nanoflares, and hinting at their important role in coronal heating.},
