  abstract = {The properties that are expected of ``hot'' non-flaring 
plasmas due to nanoflare heating in active regions are investigated
using hydrodynamic modeling tools, including a two-fluid development of
the Enthalpy Based Thermal Evolution of Loops code. Here we study a
single nanoflare and show that while simple models predict an emission
measure distribution extending well above 10 MK, which is consistent
with cooling by thermal conduction, many other effects are likely to
limit the existence and detectability of such plasmas. These include:
differential heating between electrons and ions, ionization
non-equilibrium, and for short nanoflares, the time taken for the
coronal density to increase. The most useful temperature range to look
for this plasma, often called the ``smoking gun'' of nanoflare
heating, lies between 106.6 and 107 K. Signatures
of the actual heating may be detectable in some instances.},

  title = {Differential Emission Measures from the Regularized Inversion of {{Hinode}} and {{SDO}} Data},

  issn = {0004-6361},
  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201117576},
  abstract = {Aims: To demonstrate the capabilities of regularized inversion to 
recover differential emission measures (DEMs) from multi-wavelength
observations provided by telescopes such as Hinode and SDO. 
Methods: We develop and apply an enhanced regularization algorithm, used
in RHESSI X-ray spectral analysis, to constrain the ill-posed inverse
problem that is determining the DEM from solar observations. We
demonstrate this computationally fast technique applied to a range of
DEM models simulating broadband imaging data from SDO/AIA and high
resolution line spectra from Hinode/EIS, as well as actual active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT. As this regularization method
naturally provides both vertical and horizontal (temperature resolution)
error bars we are able to test the role of uncertainties in the data and
response functions. Results: The regularization method is able to
successfully recover the DEM from simulated data of a variety of model
DEMs (single Gaussian, multiple Gaussians and CHIANTI DEM models). It is
able to do this, at best, to over four orders of magnitude in DEM space
but typically over two orders of magnitude from peak emission. The
combination of horizontal and vertical error bars and the regularized
solution matrix allows us to easily determine the accuracy and
robustness of the regularized DEM. We find that the typical range for
the horizontal errors is $\Delta$log T $\approx$ 0.1-0.5 and this is dependent
on the observed signal to noise, uncertainty in the response functions
as well as the source model and temperature. With Hinode/EIS an
uncertainty of 20\% greatly broadens the regularized DEMs for both
Gaussian and CHIANTI models although information about the underlying
DEMs is still recoverable. When applied to real active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT the regularization method is able
to recover a DEM similar to that found via a MCMC method but in
considerably less computational time. Conclusions: Regularized
inversion quickly determines the DEM from solar observations and
provides reliable error estimates (both horizontal and vertical) which
allows the temperature spread of coronal plasma to be robustly
quantified.},
