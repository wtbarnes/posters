the Enthalpy Based Thermal Evolution of Loops code. Here we study a
single nanoflare and show that while simple models predict an emission
measure distribution extending well above 10 MK, which is consistent
with cooling by thermal conduction, many other effects are likely to
limit the existence and detectability of such plasmas. These include:
differential heating between electrons and ions, ionization
non-equilibrium, and for short nanoflares, the time taken for the
coronal density to increase. The most useful temperature range to look
for this plasma, often called the ``smoking gun'' of nanoflare
heating, lies between 106.6 and 107 K. Signatures
of the actual heating may be detectable in some instances.},

  abstract = {Context: The effects of non-equilibrium processes on the ionisation 
state of strongly emitting elements in the solar corona can be extremely
difficult to assess and yet they are critically important. For example,
there is much interest in dynamic heating events localised in the solar
corona because they are believed to be responsible for its high
temperature and yet recent work has shown that the hottest
($\geq$107 K) emission predicted to be associated with these
events can be observationally elusive due to the difficulty of creating
the highly ionised states from which the expected emission arises. This
leads to the possibility of observing instruments missing such heating
events entirely. Aims: The equations describing the evolution of
the ionisaton state are a very stiff system of coupled, partial
differential equations whose solution can be numerically challenging and
time-consuming. Without access to specialised codes and significant
computational resources it is extremely difficult to avoid the
assumption of an equilibrium ionisation state even when it clearly
cannot be justified. The aim of the current work is to develop a
computational tool to allow straightforward calculation of the
time-dependent ionisation state for a wide variety of physical
circumstances. Methods: A numerical model comprising the system
of time-dependent ionisation equations for a particular element and
tabulated values of plasma temperature as a function of time is
developed. The tabulated values can be the solutions of an analytical
model, the output from a numerical code or a set of observational
measurements. An efficient numerical method to solve the ionisation
equations is implemented. Results: A suite of tests is designed
and run to demonstrate that the code provides reliable and accurate
solutions for a number of scenarios including equilibration of the ion
population and rapid heating followed by thermal conductive cooling. It
is found that the solver can evolve the ionisation state to recover
exactly the equilibrium state found by an independent, steady-state
solver for all temperatures, resolve the extremely small
ionisation/recombination timescales associated with rapid temperature
changes at high densities, and provide stable and accurate solutions for
both dominant and minor ion population fractions. Rapid heating and
cooling of low to moderate density plasma is characterised by
significant non-equilibrium ionisation conditions. The effective
ionisation temperatures are significantly lower than the electron
temperature and the values found are in close agreement with the
previous work of others. At the very highest densities included in the
present study an assumption of equilibrium ionisation is found to be
robust. Conclusions: The computational tool presented here
provides a straightforward and reliable way to calculate ionisation
states for a wide variety of physical circumstances. The numerical code
gives results that are accurate and consistent with previous studies,
has relatively undemanding computational requirements and is freely
available from the author.},

observations recorded by the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer

observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We present the first spatially
resolved maps of the EM slope in the 1-3 MK range within the core of the
AR using several methods, either from approximations or from the
differential emission measure (DEM). A significant variation of the
slope is found at different spatial locations within the active region.
We selected two regions that were not greatly affected by lower
temperature emission along the line of sight. We found that the EM had a
power law of the form EM $\propto$ Tb, with b = 4.4 $\pm$
0.4, and 4.6 $\pm$ 0.4, during the first and second appearance of the
active region, respectively. During the second rotation, line-of-sight
effects become more important, although difficult to estimate. We found
that the use of the ground calibration for Hinode/EIS and the
approximate method to derive the EM, used in previous publications,
produce an underestimation of the slopes. The EM distribution in active
region cores is generally found to be consistent with high frequency
heating, and does not change much during the evolution of the active
region.},

  abstract = {The "smoking gun" of small-scale, impulsive events heating the solar 
corona is expected to be the presence of hot ($>$5 MK) plasma. Evidence
for this has been scarce, but has gradually begun to accumulate due to
recent studies designed to constrain the high-temperature part of the
emission measure distribution. However, the detected hot component is
often weaker than models predict and this is due in part to the common
modeling assumption that the ionization balance remains in equilibrium.
The launch of the latest generation of space-based observing
instrumentation on board Hinode and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
has brought the matter of the ionization state of the plasma firmly to
the forefront. It is timely to consider exactly what emission current
instruments would detect when observing a corona heated impulsively on
small scales by nanoflares. Only after we understand the full effects of
nonequilibrium ionization can we draw meaningful conclusions about the
plasma that is (or is not) present. We have therefore performed a series
of hydrodynamic simulations for a variety of different nanoflare
properties and initial conditions. Our study has led to several key
conclusions. (1) Deviations from equilibrium are greatest for
short-duration nanoflares at low initial coronal densities. (2) Hot
emission lines are the most affected and are suppressed sometimes to the
point of being invisible. (3) For the many scenarios we have considered,
the emission detected in several of the SDO-AIA channels (131, 193, and
211 {\AA}) would be dominated by warm, overdense, cooling plasma. (4)
It is difficult not to create coronal loops that emit strongly at 1.5 MK
and in the range 2-6 MK, which are the most commonly observed kind, for
a broad range of nanoflare scenarios. (5) The Fe XV (284.16 {\AA})
emission in most of our models is about 10 times brighter than the Ca
XVII (192.82 {\AA}) emission, consistent with observations. Our
overarching conclusion is that small-scale, impulsive heating inducing a
nonequilibrium ionization state leads to predictions for observable
quantities that are entirely consistent with what is actually observed.},

simulations of nanoflare trains are used to demonstrate the dependence
of a on the time between individual nanoflares (TN ) and the

few thousand seconds, a $<$ 3. For smaller values, trains of equally
spaced nanoflares cannot account for the observed range of a if the
distribution of nanoflare energies is either constant, randomly
distributed, or a power law. Power law distributions where there is a
delay between consecutive nanoflares proportional to the energy of the
second nanoflare do lead to the observed range of a. However,
TN must then be of the order of hundreds to no more than a
few thousand seconds. If a nanoflare leads to the relaxation of a
stressed coronal field to a near-potential state, the time taken to
build up the required magnetic energy is thus too long to account for
the EM measurements. Instead, it is suggested that a nanoflare involves
the relaxation from one stressed coronal state to another, dissipating
only a small fraction of the available magnetic energy. A consequence is
that nanoflare energies may be smaller than previously envisioned.},

solar active region using instruments on Hinode and the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). These multi-instrument observations allow us to
determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the
evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the
apex of the high-temperature loops the emission measure distribution is
strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower
temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK
is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK.
We also find that the temporal evolution in broadband soft X-ray images
is relatively constant over about 6 hr of observing. Observations in the
cooler SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) bandpasses generally do
not show cooling loops in the core of the active region, consistent with
the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations
suggest that the high-temperature loops observed in the core of an
active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to
reproduce the relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines
with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events
occur on timescales much less than a characteristic cooling time. In
contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to
describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the

low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too
large. We also present an initial look at images from the SDO/AIA 94

Such measurements are critical for constraining theories of coronal heating. Past analysis, however, has suffered from limited sample sizes and large uncertainties at temperatures between 5 and 10~MK. Here we present a systematic study of the differential emission measure distribution in 15 active region cores. We focus on measurements in the inter-moss region, that is, the region between the loop footpoints, where the observations are easier to interpret. To reduce the uncertainties at the highest temperatures we present a new method for isolating the Fe XVIII emission in the AIA/SDO 94 {\AA} channel. The resulting differential emission measure distributions confirm our previous analysis showing that the temperature distribution in an active region core is often strongly peaked near 4~MK. We characterize the properties of the emission distribution as a function of the total unsigned magnetic flux. We find that the amount of high-temperature emission in the active region core is correlated with the total unsigned magnetic flux, while the emission at lower temperatures, in contrast, is inversely related. These results provide compelling evidence that high-temperature active region emission is often close to equilibrium, although weaker active regions may be dominated by evolving million degree loops in the core.},

heating scenario that has been proposed to reconcile such observations
with impulsive heating models is the "long nanoflare storm," where
short-duration heating events occur infrequently on many sub-resolution
strands; the emission of the strands is then averaged together to
explain the observed steady structures. In this Letter, we examine the
emission measure distribution predicted for such a long nanoflare storm
by modeling an arcade of strands in an active region core. Comparisons
of the computed emission measure distributions with recent observations
indicate that the long nanoflare storm scenario implies greater than
five times more 1 MK emission than is actually observed for all
plausible combinations of loop lengths, heating rates, and abundances.
We conjecture that if the plasma had "super coronal" abundances, the
model may be able to match the observations at low temperatures.},

intensities and velocities measured in active region cores are
effectively steady, suggesting that heating events occur rapidly enough
to keep high-temperature active region loops close to equilibrium. In
this paper, we couple observations of active region (AR) 10955 made with
the X-Ray Telescope and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on board Hinode to
test a simple steady heating model. First we calculate the differential
emission measure (DEM) of the apex region of the loops in the active
region core. We find the DEM to be broad and peaked around 3 MK. We then
determine the densities in the corresponding footpoint regions. Using
potential field extrapolations to approximate the loop lengths and the
density-sensitive line ratios to infer the magnitude of the heating, we
build a steady heating model for the active region core and find that we
can match the general properties of the observed DEM for the temperature
range of 6.3 $<$ log T $<$ 6.7. This model, for the first time,
accounts for the base pressure, loop length, and distribution of apex
temperatures of the core loops. We find that the density-sensitive
spectral line intensities and the bulk of the hot emission in the active
region core are consistent with steady heating. We also find, however,
that the steady heating model cannot address the emission observed at
lower temperatures. This emission may be due to foreground or background
structures, or may indicate that the heating in the core is more
complicated. Different heating scenarios must be tested to determine if
they have the same level of agreement.},

error bars we are able to test the role of uncertainties in the data and
response functions. Results: The regularization method is able to
successfully recover the DEM from simulated data of a variety of model
DEMs (single Gaussian, multiple Gaussians and CHIANTI DEM models). It is
able to do this, at best, to over four orders of magnitude in DEM space
but typically over two orders of magnitude from peak emission. The
combination of horizontal and vertical error bars and the regularized
solution matrix allows us to easily determine the accuracy and
robustness of the regularized DEM. We find that the typical range for
the horizontal errors is $\Delta$log T $\approx$ 0.1-0.5 and this is dependent
on the observed signal to noise, uncertainty in the response functions
as well as the source model and temperature. With Hinode/EIS an
uncertainty of 20\% greatly broadens the regularized DEMs for both
Gaussian and CHIANTI models although information about the underlying
DEMs is still recoverable. When applied to real active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT the regularization method is able
to recover a DEM similar to that found via a MCMC method but in
considerably less computational time. Conclusions: Regularized
inversion quickly determines the DEM from solar observations and
provides reliable error estimates (both horizontal and vertical) which
allows the temperature spread of coronal plasma to be robustly
quantified.},

  abstract = {Despite its prediction over two decades ago, the detection of faint, 
high-temperature (``hot'') emission due to nanoflare heating
in non-flaring active region cores has proved challenging. Using an
efficient two-fluid hydrodynamic model, this paper investigates the
properties of the emission expected from repeating nanoflares (a
nanoflare train) of varying frequency as well as the separate heating of
electrons and ions. If the emission measure distribution (EM(T)) peaks
at T = T m , we find that EM(T m ) is
independent of details of the nanoflare train, and EM(T) above and below
T m reflects different aspects of the heating. Below T
 m , the main influence is the relationship of the waiting
time between successive nanoflares to the nanoflare energy. Above T
 m , power-law nanoflare distributions lead to an extensive
plasma population not present in a mono-energetic train. Furthermore, in
some cases, characteristic features are present in EM(T). Such details
may be detectable given adequate spectral resolution and a good
knowledge of the relevant atomic physics. In the absence of such
resolution we propose some metrics that can be used to infer the
presence of ``hot'' plasma.},

  abstract = {This paper presents SunPy (version 0.5), a community-developed Python package for solar physics. Python, a free, cross-platform,
general-purpose, high-level programming language, has seen widespread adoption among the scientific community, resulting in the availability of a large number of software packages, from numerical computation (NumPy, SciPy) and machine learning (scikit-learn) to visualization and plotting (matplotlib). SunPy is a data-analysis environment specializing in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It
currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and
STEREO/SWAVES. We describe SunPy's functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools already available in Python. We discuss the future goals of the project and encourage interested users to become involved in the planning and development of SunPy.},

A key feature is that the data are assessed and regularly updated, with version 8 released in 2015. Atomic data for modeling the emissivities of 246 ions and neutrals are contained in CHIANTI, together with data for deriving the ionization fractions of all elements up to zinc. The different types of atomic data are summarized here and their formats discussed.
