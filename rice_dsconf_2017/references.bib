  abstract = {This paper develops the zero-dimensional (0D) hydrodynamic coronal loop model "Enthalpy-based Thermal Evolution of Loops" (EBTEL) proposed by Klimchuk et al., which studies the plasma response to evolving coronal heating, especially impulsive heating events. The basis of EBTEL is the modeling of mass exchange between the corona and transition region (TR) and chromosphere in response to heating variations, with the key parameter being the ratio of the TR to coronal radiation. We develop new models for this parameter that now include gravitational stratification and a physically motivated approach to radiative cooling. A number of examples are presented, including nanoflares in short and long loops, and a small flare. The new features in EBTEL are important for accurate tracking of, in particular, the density. The 0D results are compared to a 1D hydro code (Hydrad) with generally good agreement. EBTEL is suitable for general use as a tool for (1) quick-look results of loop evolution in response to a given heating function, (2) extensive parameter surveys, and (3) situations where the modeling of hundreds or thousands of elemental loops is needed. A single run takes a few seconds on a contemporary laptop.},

measure distribution extending well above 10 MK, which is consistent
with cooling by thermal conduction, many other effects are likely to
limit the existence and detectability of such plasmas. These include:
differential heating between electrons and ions, ionization
non-equilibrium, and for short nanoflares, the time taken for the
coronal density to increase. The most useful temperature range to look
for this plasma, often called the ``smoking gun'' of nanoflare
heating, lies between 106.6 and 107 K. Signatures
of the actual heating may be detectable in some instances.},

One telescope observes C iv (near 1600 {\AA}) and the nearby continuum (1700 {\AA}) and has a filter that observes in the visible to enable coalignment with images from other telescopes. The temperature diagnostics of the EUV emissions cover the range from 6\texttimes{}104 K to 2\texttimes{}107 K. The AIA was launched as a part of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission on 11 February 2010.

  doi = {10.1086/589426},
  abstract = {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial resolution, and one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so zero-dimensional (0D) models are an acceptable alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called ``enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops'' (EBTEL), which accurately describes the evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It improves significantly on earlier models of this type-in accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating; it provides the time-dependent differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydrodynamic simulations despite using 4 orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and stellar studies.},

  doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/753/1/35},
  abstract = {A well-known behavior of EUV light curves of discrete coronal loops is 
that the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are
reached at progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag
is understood to be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling
through these lower respective temperatures. However, loops typically
comprise only a minority of the total emission in active regions (ARs).
Is this cooling pattern a common property of AR coronal plasma, or does
it only occur in unique circumstances, locations, and times? The new
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) data
provide a wonderful opportunity to answer this question systematically
for an entire AR. We measure the time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV
channels using 24 hr of images of AR 11082 observed on 2010 June 19. We
find that there is a time-lag signal consistent with cooling plasma,
just as is usually found for loops, throughout the AR including the
diffuse emission between loops for the entire 24 hr duration. The
pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and choice of window
length within the 24 hr time period, giving us confidence that the
plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and sometimes
exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}0.8 MK. This suggests
that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this AR is not steady;
rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements
provide crucial constraints on any model which seeks to describe coronal
heating.},

processes. Observations indicate that EM(T) \textasciitilde{} Ta below
approximately 4 MK, with 2 $<$ a $<$ 5. Zero-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations of nanoflare trains are used to demonstrate the dependence
of a on the time between individual nanoflares (TN ) and the
distribution of nanoflare energies. If TN is greater than a
few thousand seconds, a $<$ 3. For smaller values, trains of equally
spaced nanoflares cannot account for the observed range of a if the
distribution of nanoflare energies is either constant, randomly
distributed, or a power law. Power law distributions where there is a
delay between consecutive nanoflares proportional to the energy of the
second nanoflare do lead to the observed range of a. However,
TN must then be of the order of hundreds to no more than a
few thousand seconds. If a nanoflare leads to the relaxation of a
stressed coronal field to a near-potential state, the time taken to
build up the required magnetic energy is thus too long to account for
the EM measurements. Instead, it is suggested that a nanoflare involves
the relaxation from one stressed coronal state to another, dissipating
only a small fraction of the available magnetic energy. A consequence is
that nanoflare energies may be smaller than previously envisioned.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine 15 different active regions (ARs) observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory and analyze their nanoflare properties. We have recently developed a technique that systematically identifies and measures plasma temperature dynamics by computing time lags between light curves. The time lag method tests whether the plasma is maintained at a steady temperature, or if it is dynamic, undergoing heating and cooling cycles. An important aspect of our technique is that it analyzes both observationally distinct coronal loops as well as the much more prevalent diffuse emission between them. We find that the widespread cooling reported previously for NOAA AR 11082 is a generic property of all ARs. The results are consistent with impulsive nanoflare heating followed by slower cooling. Only occasionally, however, is there full cooling from above 7 MK to well below 1 MK. More often, the plasma cools to approximately 1\textendash{}2 MK before being reheated by another nanoflare. These same 15 ARs were first studied by Warren et al. We find that the degree of cooling is not well correlated with the reported slopes of the emission measure distribution. We also conclude that the Fe xviii emitting plasma that they measured is mostly in a state of cooling. These results support the idea that nanoflares have a distribution of energies and frequencies, with the average delay between successive events on an individual flux tube being comparable to the plasma cooling timescale.},

  abstract = {Despite its prediction over two decades ago, the detection of faint, 
high-temperature (``hot'') emission due to nanoflare heating
in non-flaring active region cores has proved challenging. Using an
efficient two-fluid hydrodynamic model, this paper investigates the
properties of the emission expected from repeating nanoflares (a
nanoflare train) of varying frequency as well as the separate heating of
electrons and ions. If the emission measure distribution (EM(T)) peaks
at T = T m , we find that EM(T m ) is
independent of details of the nanoflare train, and EM(T) above and below
T m reflects different aspects of the heating. Below T
 m , the main influence is the relationship of the waiting
time between successive nanoflares to the nanoflare energy. Above T
 m , power-law nanoflare distributions lead to an extensive
plasma population not present in a mono-energetic train. Furthermore, in
some cases, characteristic features are present in EM(T). Such details
may be detectable given adequate spectral resolution and a good
knowledge of the relevant atomic physics. In the absence of such
resolution we propose some metrics that can be used to infer the
presence of ``hot'' plasma.},
