  abstract = {The properties that are expected of ``hot'' non-flaring 
plasmas due to nanoflare heating in active regions are investigated
using hydrodynamic modeling tools, including a two-fluid development of
the Enthalpy Based Thermal Evolution of Loops code. Here we study a
single nanoflare and show that while simple models predict an emission
measure distribution extending well above 10 MK, which is consistent
with cooling by thermal conduction, many other effects are likely to
limit the existence and detectability of such plasmas. These include:
differential heating between electrons and ions, ionization
non-equilibrium, and for short nanoflares, the time taken for the
coronal density to increase. The most useful temperature range to look
for this plasma, often called the ``smoking gun'' of nanoflare
heating, lies between 106.6 and 107 K. Signatures
of the actual heating may be detectable in some instances.},

  abstract = {A well-known behavior of EUV light curves of discrete coronal loops is 
that the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are
reached at progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag
is understood to be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling
through these lower respective temperatures. However, loops typically
comprise only a minority of the total emission in active regions (ARs).
Is this cooling pattern a common property of AR coronal plasma, or does
it only occur in unique circumstances, locations, and times? The new
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) data
provide a wonderful opportunity to answer this question systematically
for an entire AR. We measure the time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV
channels using 24 hr of images of AR 11082 observed on 2010 June 19. We
find that there is a time-lag signal consistent with cooling plasma,
just as is usually found for loops, throughout the AR including the
diffuse emission between loops for the entire 24 hr duration. The
pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and choice of window
length within the 24 hr time period, giving us confidence that the
plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and sometimes
exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}0.8 MK. This suggests
that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this AR is not steady;
rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements
provide crucial constraints on any model which seeks to describe coronal
heating.},

  abstract = {The temperature dependence of the emission measure (EM) in the core of 
active regions coronal loops is an important diagnostic of heating
processes. Observations indicate that EM(T) \textasciitilde{} Ta below
approximately 4 MK, with 2 $<$ a $<$ 5. Zero-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations of nanoflare trains are used to demonstrate the dependence
of a on the time between individual nanoflares (TN ) and the
distribution of nanoflare energies. If TN is greater than a
few thousand seconds, a $<$ 3. For smaller values, trains of equally
spaced nanoflares cannot account for the observed range of a if the
distribution of nanoflare energies is either constant, randomly
distributed, or a power law. Power law distributions where there is a
delay between consecutive nanoflares proportional to the energy of the
second nanoflare do lead to the observed range of a. However,
TN must then be of the order of hundreds to no more than a
few thousand seconds. If a nanoflare leads to the relaxation of a
stressed coronal field to a near-potential state, the time taken to
build up the required magnetic energy is thus too long to account for
the EM measurements. Instead, it is suggested that a nanoflare involves
the relaxation from one stressed coronal state to another, dissipating
only a small fraction of the available magnetic energy. A consequence is
that nanoflare energies may be smaller than previously envisioned.},

We refer to the basic unit of impulsive energy release as a nanoflare. The observations suggest, then, that the active X-ray corona of the sun is to be
understood as a swarm of nanoflares. This interpretation suggests that the X-ray corona is created by the dissipation at the many tangential discontinuities arising spontaneously in the bipolar fields of the active regions of the sun as a consequence of random continuous motion of the footpoints of the field in the photospheric convection. The quantitative characteristics of the process are inferred from the observed coronal heat input.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine 15 different active regions (ARs) observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory and analyze their nanoflare properties. We have recently developed a technique that systematically identifies and measures plasma temperature dynamics by computing time lags between light curves. The time lag method tests whether the plasma is maintained at a steady temperature, or if it is dynamic, undergoing heating and cooling cycles. An important aspect of our technique is that it analyzes both observationally distinct coronal loops as well as the much more prevalent diffuse emission between them. We find that the widespread cooling reported previously for NOAA AR 11082 is a generic property of all ARs. The results are consistent with impulsive nanoflare heating followed by slower cooling. Only occasionally, however, is there full cooling from above 7 MK to well below 1 MK. More often, the plasma cools to approximately 1\textendash{}2 MK before being reheated by another nanoflare. These same 15 ARs were first studied by Warren et al. We find that the degree of cooling is not well correlated with the reported slopes of the emission measure distribution. We also conclude that the Fe xviii emitting plasma that they measured is mostly in a state of cooling. These results support the idea that nanoflares have a distribution of energies and frequencies, with the average delay between successive events on an individual flux tube being comparable to the plasma cooling timescale.},

  abstract = {Despite its prediction over two decades ago, the detection of faint, 
high-temperature (``hot'') emission due to nanoflare heating
in non-flaring active region cores has proved challenging. Using an
efficient two-fluid hydrodynamic model, this paper investigates the
properties of the emission expected from repeating nanoflares (a
nanoflare train) of varying frequency as well as the separate heating of
electrons and ions. If the emission measure distribution (EM(T)) peaks
at T = T m , we find that EM(T m ) is
independent of details of the nanoflare train, and EM(T) above and below
T m reflects different aspects of the heating. Below T
 m , the main influence is the relationship of the waiting
time between successive nanoflares to the nanoflare energy. Above T
 m , power-law nanoflare distributions lead to an extensive
plasma population not present in a mono-energetic train. Furthermore, in
some cases, characteristic features are present in EM(T). Such details
may be detectable given adequate spectral resolution and a good
knowledge of the relevant atomic physics. In the absence of such
resolution we propose some metrics that can be used to infer the
presence of ``hot'' plasma.},
